# Challenge1Selenium

Selenium C# .NET Core 3.1
For this sample project I am following page object model using selenium c#. 
On top of it I have added BDD Framework Specflow. 

The Feature file lists the test cases for this Challenge and startingpoint would be from Hooks - HookInitialization.cs file
I have used Nunit as testing framework to run these test cases.
